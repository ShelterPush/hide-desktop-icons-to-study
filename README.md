# hide-desktop-icons-to-study
This is a DOS .bat file that hides all user-specific desktop shortcuts for a user-input amount of time. It contains checks for times near the DOS limit of seconds and incorrect user inputs.
It cannot currently hide system-wide desktop shortcuts (shortcuts placed on all users' desktops), such as game shortcuts placed by EA Origin

I primarily use this to help myself focus on studying. It is only a slight barrier to gaming, but sometimes all you need is the games not staring you in the face.
